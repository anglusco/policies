## Overview of Privacy Policy

Personal information is any information you provide to us that personally identifies you, like your name, email address or billing information, or other information which could be reasonably linked to such identifying information by us. We will only collect, use, and share your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This policy applies whether you use ClassDojo through http://www.classdojo.com (the “ClassDojo Website”), our mobile applications (the “ClassDojo Apps”), or any of our other products or services that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Service”). In addition, this Privacy Policy also covers ClassDojo's treatment of any personal information about our users that our partners or other services might share with us, for example responses to a teacher survey collected through WuFoo.

This policy does not apply to websites or services or practices of companies that we do not own or control, such as third party services that you might access through links or features on the Service. These other services have their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to review them before providing them with personal information. 

Whether you are new here (hello!), or have been using ClassDojo for a long time (thanks for all the love!), please do take the time to get to know our privacy practices. If you have any questions, we’re here to help: you can visit the ClassDojo Trust and Safety Center for more resources explaining how we protect your privacy, or send us an email at privacy@classdojo.com. By using the Service, you acknowledge that you accept and agree to this Privacy Policy.

We are proud that we have received TRUSTe's Privacy and Children’s Privacy Seal signifying that this Privacy Policy and our practices with respect to the operation of the Service have been reviewed for compliance with the TRUSTe program (viewable on the validation page available by clicking here or on the TRUSTe seal). The TRUSTe Children’s certification covers information collected on the ClassDojo Website and the ClassDojo Apps. The TRUSTe Privacy Certification covers information collected through the ClassDojo Website and the ClassDojo Apps. If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact TRUSTe here. 

ClassDojo is also a signatory to the Student Privacy Pledge, agreeing to a set of principles intended to safeguard student privacy, including responsible stewardship, protection, and transparent handling of student personal information. Read more about the Student Privacy Pledge here.

>Basically,

>Your privacy is very important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we treat any personal information that you give us when you use ClassDojo. This policy does not apply to third parties that ClassDojo does not own or control – they’ll have their own privacy policies. We have been certified by TRUSTe, an FTC approved COPPA Safe Harbor for compliance with TRUSTe's Children's Privacy Program, and have also signed the Student Privacy Pledge.

## What is ClassDojo?

ClassDojo is a classroom management platform that helps teachers encourage students and easily engage parents. In the classroom, teachers can use ClassDojo to give students encouragement (or “feedback points”) for showing critical skills or strengths - ones like persistence, critical thinking, teamwork and leadership. This can be done through either the ClassDojo App or the ClassDojo Website - if multiple devices are used, they will all sync up automatically! To make family engagement easier than ever before, teachers can instantly message with parents, and can let them see how their child is doing at school by sharing his or her student profile to highlight the feedback points they earned.

Parents get access to ClassDojo using a unique code provided by the child’s teacher, or through an email/SMS invitation directly from the teacher. Parents can only view their own children’s profiles and not those of any other students. Students can also create their own account, but only after they receive a unique code from their teacher and (if the student is under 13) have received parental consent or notice (as applicable) in order to access certain features of their account. In the student account, students can, for example, see feedback given by their teacher, as well as customize their ClassDojo avatar - a cute monster that represents the student on ClassDojo.

When students set up a ClassDojo account using a unique code, they need to submit a unique username and password. In accordance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), we ask for their age, and if they are under 13 years of age, we also ask for a parent or guardian’s email address to request parental consent. We don’t ask students to enter any other personal information.

More information on how the Service operates is located here and your participation and use of the Service is governed by our Terms of Service (“Terms”).

## How Does ClassDojo Protect Children’s Personal Information?
Protecting the privacy of children is especially important to us. This is why we have signed the Student Privacy Pledge and received TRUSTe’s Children’s Privacy Seal, signifying that this Privacy Policy and our practices with respect to the operation of the Service have been reviewed and approved for compliance with TRUSTe’s Children’s Privacy Program. COPPA protects the online privacy of children under the age of 13 (“child” or “children”); for more information about COPPA and generally protecting children’s online privacy, please visit OnGuard Online.

**What Information Does ClassDojo Collect from Children, and How Is It Used?**
ClassDojo collects the minimal amount of information from students necessary to create accounts on our Service: we ask students to provide the unique code they have been given by their teacher (students cannot sign up without this), a unique username (we advise students to not use their real name) and password. Consistent with the requirements of COPPA, we also ask for age, and a parent or guardian email address from the child so we can seek verifiable parental consent or provide parental notice (as applicable). We will not use parent emails provided for parental consent or notice purposes to market our Service to the parent, unless the parent has expressly opted in to email marketing or has separately created an account on our Service. Beyond this, the ClassDojo student account does not allow the student the ability to upload any content to their account or enter any additional personal information. In addition to the information entered by the child, we automatically collect some information from any use of our Service as set forth in the “Information Collected Automatically” section. 

We use this information to provide the Service to the child, for security and safety purposes, or as required by law or to enforce our Terms. We will not require children to provide more information than is reasonably necessary in order to participate in the Service. If we discover that we have collected information from a child in a manner inconsistent with COPPA, we will take appropriate steps to either delete the information, or immediately seek the parent’s consent for that collection. We do not disclose any personal information about children to third parties, except to service providers necessary to provide the Service, as required by law or to protect the security of our Service or other users. Information collected from students (including personal information and information collected automatically) is never used or disclosed for third party advertising, or any kind of first- or third-party behaviorally targeted advertising, and children’s personal information is never sold or rented to anyone, including marketers or advertisers.

Please note that we also receive from the child’s teacher whatever name he or she has provided for the student, and the feedback points assigned by that teacher. Teachers may choose to provide full names for students (e.g., first name and last name) when setting up their class; teachers can also opt to only provide non-identifying information (e.g., just first name, only initials, or even just seat numbers). 

> Basically,
> 
> We have been certified by TRUSTe, an FTC approved COPPA Safe Harbor for compliance with TRUSTe's Children's Privacy Program. We will not require children to provide more information than is reasonably necessary in order to participate in the Service. Information collected from students is never used or disclosed for third party advertising or any kind of behaviorally-targeted advertising, and personal information is never sold or rented to anyone, including marketers or advertisers.

**Push Notifications**
ClassDojo may send push notifications to students - for example, letting them know when their weekly report is ready or possibly of an achievement they reached! We will require a child to provide a parent email address before he or she can receive push notifications from ClassDojo. We will then provide the parent with notice of our collection and provide the parent the opportunity to prevent further notifications. The device identifier for these children will only be associated with other personal information once parental consent is provided. If you are a student or a parent of a child and no longer wish for these communications to be sent, either turn off the push notifications on your device directly or contact us at privacy@classdojo.com.

> Basically,
> 
> Before ever sending a push notification to a child, we will provide notice to parents or obtain parental consent! Parents can always opt out later as well.

**What Children’s Information is Visible to Others?**
No student profiles are made available or visible to the public, or to other students, through ClassDojo. Teachers may share their classes, including feedback points, with other teachers they co-teach with in their school, to help them collaborate. If the teacher chooses to display ClassDojo in their classroom, such as projecting via a smartboard or interactive whiteboard, students physically present in that classroom may see other students’ names, avatar (which can be default avatars, or avatars modified by students) and aggregated total feedback points (similar to how paper-based sticker charts displayed in a classroom might work). Students’ full profiles showing each feedback point awarded are not shown in this class view (just the avatar, if modified by the student, is shown), and are therefore kept private for each student, their teacher, and their parents. Teachers can of course choose not to display ClassDojo this way, for example by using the ClassDojo App — and many do!

> Basically,
> 
> Student’s full profiles are private to their teachers, other teachers that the teacher shares the class with, their parents, and students themselves! Only their aggregated total points and their avatar can be seen by others in class if a teacher is using the ClassDojo Website and chooses to display the class.

**How Long Does ClassDojo Keep Children’s Information?**
We only keep a child’s personal information for as long as the student account is active, unless we are required by law to retain it, need it to ensure the security of our users and our Service, or to enforce our Terms. More specifically, ClassDojo operates a 3-tier student data protection policy to protect all students’ (not just children’s) information (“3-Tier Student Data Protection Policy”): 

1. Minimal information: As mentioned before, ClassDojo collects the minimal amount of information from students necessary to create accounts on our Service: we ask students to provide just the unique student code given by their teacher (students cannot sign up without this), a username, and a password. We advise students to not use any personal information in their username. Consistent with the requirements of COPPA, we ask students for their age, and a parent or guardian email address if they are under 13 years of age so we can seek verifiable parental consent or provide parental notice (as applicable). Beyond this, the ClassDojo student account does not allow the student the ability to upload any content to their account or enter any additional personal information. In addition to the information entered by the child, we automatically collect some information from any use of our Service as set forth in the “Information Collected Automatically” section. 

2. One year deletion policy for feedback points: To protect students, ClassDojo sets limits on how long feedback points on student profiles are retained. For all students, feedback points older than 12 months are automatically deleted - unless the student or their parent chooses to retain them by creating their own associated account. For example, if a teacher sets up a class on ClassDojo on January 1, 2016, unless students or parents create accounts, on January 1, 2017, any feedback points given in that class on or before January 1, 2016 would be deleted (and will continue to be deleted on an ongoing basis as each point reaches 12 months in age). This means feedback points cannot exist long-term without either being deleted automatically, or students or parents knowing about them and being able to access and delete them on their own (by deleting both the parent and student account entirely)!  Teachers can delete feedback points at anytime.

3. Deleting inactive accounts: If a student’s account is inactive for twelve months or more (meaning no teacher has given feedback to the student or messaged with the student’s parent, and neither the parent nor the student have logged into his or her account), ClassDojo will delete the student account, automatically deleting personal information provided by students or collected by ClassDojo from students, as well as feedback points associated with the account that are more than 12 months old. Learn more about how we delete student accounts here.

> Basically,
> 
> We only keep a child’s personal information for as long as the account is active, unless we are required by law to retain it,  need it to ensure the security of our users and our Service, or to enforce our Terms. Additionally, we protect students with our 3-Tier Student Data Protection Policy: (1) we collect only minimal information about students, (2) we automatically delete their feedback points after a year - unless students or parents choose to save them for longer, and (3) we delete student accounts if they are inactive for a period of 1 year.

**Parental Choices**
If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child who has created an account with us and you did not receive an email providing notice or seeking your consent (as per COPPA), you can email us at privacy@classdojo.com to have that child’s account deleted.

Any parents that wish to obtain copies of their children’s personal information that we may have stored can contact us either by sending an email at privacy@classdojo.com or as described in the “How to Contact ClassDojo With Questions” section below. At any time, parents can refuse to permit us to collect further personal information from their children, and can request that we delete the personal information we have collected in connection with that account by contacting us as per the “How to Contact ClassDojo with Questions” section below. Please keep in mind that deleting records may require us to terminate the account. Also remember that before we can either give you the information or delete it per your request, we will need to verify your identity, such as by requiring that you provide acceptable forms of personal identification.

> Basically,
> 
> Parents can always decide to remove consent, delete their child's account, request us to delete their child’s personal information, or obtain a copy of their child's personal information — just email us!

## What Information Does ClassDojo Collect?

We collect two types of information about you: (1) information that you voluntarily provide us through the use of the ClassDojo Service (described below under “Information You Provide to Us”) and (2) information automatically collected as result of your use of the Service (described below under “Information Collected Automatically”). The types and amounts of information collected through the use of ClassDojo will vary depending on whether the user is a teacher, parent or student (e.g. we collect minimal information from students) and how they use ClassDojo (e.g. if teachers join their school, we may need to collect school address information).

> Basically,
> 
> ClassDojo collects information directly from teachers, parents, and students (such as account information), and also collects information automatically (such as reports when errors occur) in order to provide a great Service!

### Information You Provide to Us
There are currently three categories of users on our Service: teachers, parents, and students. We describe the information collected from students under 13 in the section above; for other users, we collect and store the following different types of information from each type of user:

* **Account Sign-up and Profile Information**: To create a ClassDojo account as a teacher or parent, you may be asked to provide some basic information such as your first and last name, email address, telephone number, password and a profile photo. If you create a ClassDojo account as a student, you will be asked to enter the unique code you have been given by your teacher (students are unable to sign up for the Service without this), along with a unique username and password. Per COPPA, we may also ask for your age and, if you are under 13, a parent or guardian’s email address so we can give parents notice or seek parental consent as appropriate. We don’t ask students to enter any other personal information, and students currently cannot enter any additional personal information through the use of our Service. Teacher profiles may be viewed by other teachers in the same school. No teacher, parent or student profile is made available or visible to the general public through the functionality of our Service.
 
* **School Information**: If you are a teacher, as part of the profile information you provide, you may choose to associate your account with an existing school or may enter a new school name and possibly your school’s address if we do not have it already. If you are using the Service as a teacher, we may ask you for permission to collect and store your precise geolocation information to help us identify schools located nearby for you. By connecting with your school, the Service may enable and provide additional collaboration features for teachers within the same school such as sharing information about student feedback points. Learn more about our current collaboration features and what information will be shared here.

* **Class Information**: As a teacher you’ll need to enter the class year (e.g., first grade) and the names of the students in your class (these may or may not be the student’s actual first and last names - it is entirely the teacher’s choice what they enter here: for example, teachers could enter ‘John S’, ‘John’, ‘JS’, or ‘Student 23’ to describe the same person). If a teacher opts to share the classes they set up on ClassDojo with other teachers in their school, such as those that they co-teach with, then the other teachers can also see that class’s information.

* **Inviting Others**: As a teacher, you can invite the parents of your students to join the Service, for example by providing their email address or phone number (to invite them via SMS). As a parent or teacher you can also invite others to join the Service by utilizing your own native mobile application functionality through the ClassDojo App, for example by email, SMS, or sharing via Facebook or Twitter. We will collect and store the email and phone numbers you provide with these requests, and will also treat this as personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We may also ask you for access to the contacts on your mobile device to prevent you having to enter contact information for those invitations you send through our application and may store these contacts from your address book. If these individuals would like to request deletion of their information, they may contact us directly at privacy@classdojo.com.
 
* **Feedback points**: As a teacher, you can customize a list of feedback types that you want to encourage or recognize using feedback points, such as persistence, teamwork, or leadership. These feedback points cannot be viewed by the general public through our Service. A student’s feedback points can be viewed through the Service by that student, the teacher who awarded them, that student’s parents, and other teachers the class is shared with. If the teacher chooses to display totals to the class, other students in the class may be able to see each other’s aggregated totals (but not individual feedback points).

* **Messaging**: As a teacher you can privately message with individual parents that have signed up for the Service, or send broadcast messages to all parents at once, using the ClassDojo Messaging feature. Teachers and parents can send each other messages, which can also include things such as photos, voice notes and virtual stickers. As a teacher or parent, your name and profile photo may be displayed to the person with whom you are messaging, and if you are a teacher, you may receive a ‘read receipt’ showing how many parents have read your message. We will store messages, and any content sent with the messages (e.g., photos), to provide the Service, and to help teachers keep a log of their communications with parents. 

* **Contact Information**: When you choose to provide us with your personal information through the Service in some other manner (e.g., when you send us an email asking a question, submit a support request, participate in a video testimonial about our Service, or choose to participate in any research efforts with ClassDojo to improve the Service).

Our use of the information above is described below in the section “How Does ClassDojo Use the Information it Collects”. If you are using the ClassDojo App, we may ask you for certain permissions - please click here for more detail about those permissions.

> Basically,
> 
> We collect different types of information directly from you based on who you are (i.e., teacher, parent, and student) and depending on the features you might use (i.e., sending a message between a teacher and a parent)!

### Information Collected Automatically
Like most web-based services, we (or our service providers) may automatically receive and log information on our server logs from your browser or your device when you use the Service. For example, this could include the frequency and duration of your visits to ClassDojo (similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show). If you use ClassDojo on different devices, we may link the information we collect from those different devices to help us provide a consistent Service across your different devices. If we do combine any automatically-collected information with personal information, we will treat the combined information as personal information, and it will be protected as per this Privacy Policy.

The technologies and information we automatically collect include:

**Cookies and other similar technologies**
We (or our service providers) may use various technologies to collect and store information when you visit our Service including, clear GIFs (also known as “web beacons”), “tags”, “scripts”, and “cookies”. We use both session and persistent cookies: a session cookie disappears after you close your browser; a persistent cookie remains after you close your browser (although it can be removed) and may be used by your browser to identify you on subsequent visits to the Service. We may also use, collect and store information locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage (including HTML 5). Like many services, ClassDojo uses these technologies to tailor the Service for you, and to help the Service work better for you - for example, by remembering your language preferences.

Please read our Cookie Policy for more details, including how to remove or modify your cookie settings.

**Device information**
We collect device-specific information such as your operating system, hardware version, device settings, file and software names and types, battery and signal strength, and device identifiers. These help us measure how the Service is performing, improve ClassDojo for you on your particular device, and send you push notifications if you’ve opted in to receive them. 

**Log information**
Like most online services, when you use our Service, we automatically collect and store certain information in our server logs. Examples include things like:

* details of how you used our service, such as your activity on the Service, and the frequency and duration of your visits to the ClassDojo Website or ClassDojo App (similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show);
* telephony log information like your phone number and SMS routing information;
* IP Address; and
* device event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL.

This information helps us decide which parts of the Service need most improvement - for example, by showing us which features are most (or least!) popular.
 
**Location information**
When you use our Service we may collect and process information about your geographic location, such as through GPS, Bluetooth, or WiFi signals. We collect both course (i.e., city-level) location data and precise location data. If we collect precise geolocation information (sufficient to identify street name and name of city or town) from you, (such as when a teacher is searching for a school) we obtain opt-in permission. We do not collect precise geolocation data from students. We will not store or track your device location on an on-going basis or without your permission. We do not share precise geo-location data with third parties, other than our service providers as necessary to provide the Service. If you no longer wish to allow us to track your location information, you may opt-out at any time by turning it off at the device level.

> Basically,
> 
> We collect information from you automatically so that we know when things go wrong or to provide access to great features on ClassDojo! Take a look at our Cookie Policy to see what types of technologies we use to do this. If we collect precise geolocation data from you, we will obtain opt-in consent. We do not collect precise geolocation data from students.

## How Does ClassDojo Use the Information it Collects?

First and foremost, you should know that ClassDojo does not sell or rent any of your personal information to any third party for any purpose - including for advertising or marketing purposes. Third-party advertising is not permitted on ClassDojo. We use the information we collect from you to provide you with the best experience with ClassDojo; more specifically, this information is used to:
 
* Provide and improve the Service, for example by developing new products and features;
* Respond to your requests for information or customer support;
* Customize the Service for you, and improve your experience with it;
* Send you information about new features and ClassDojo products we believe you may be interested in;
* Most crucially, to protect the ClassDojo community by making sure the Service remains safe and secure.

We use automatically collected information (described in the “Information Collected Automatically” section above) to provide and support our Service, and for the additional uses described in this section of our Privacy Policy.

> Basically,
> 
> ClassDojo will never sell or rent your information to third-parties. Also, third party advertising is not permitted on ClassDojo. We only collect information when it can help provide you a better experience on ClassDojo.

Will ClassDojo Share Any Information it Collects?

First and foremost, you should know that ClassDojo does not sell or rent your (or your children's) personal information to any third party for any purpose - including for advertising or marketing purposes. Third-party advertising is not permitted on ClassDojo. Furthermore, we do not share personal information with any third parties except in the limited circumstances described in this Privacy Policy: 

**Other Users You Share and Communicate with on ClassDojo**: No teacher, parent or student profiles are made available to the general public through our Service. Furthermore, students cannot share their account information (except their avatar) with anyone on ClassDojo. If you are a teacher or a parent, you may choose to share information or content through the Service with other ClassDojo teachers or parents - for example, things like your account information, feedback points awarded to students you teach (if you are a teacher) or to your children (if you are a parent) or other information you share with teachers or parents you are messaging through the ClassDojo Messaging feature or our other collaboration features. 

Please keep in mind that information (including personal Information or children's personal information) or content that you voluntarily disclose to others - including to other ClassDojo users you interact with through the Service (such as messages you might send other users or other teachers you collaborate with) - can be viewed, copied, stored, and used by the people you share it with. We cannot control the actions of people with whom you choose to share information.

**Third-party integrations on our Service**: When, as a teacher or parent, you use third-party apps, websites or other services that use, or are integrated with, our Service, they may receive information about what you post or share. For example, when you invite others via Facebook or Twitter, these services receive the information that you share through this functionality, and information that you are sharing this from ClassDojo. Information collected by these apps, websites or integrated services is subject to their own terms and policies.

**Service Providers**: Third party advertising is not permitted on ClassDojo. We do work with vendors, service providers, and other partners to help us provide the Service by performing tasks on our behalf - often because we cannot build everything ourselves! We may need to share or provide information (including personal information) to them to help them perform these business functions, for example sending emails on our behalf, database management services, database hosting, providing customer support software, and security. Please see here for a list of the third parties we work with to provide the Service. Generally, these partners do not have the right to use your personal information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. Additionally, these partners must adhere to confidentiality and security obligations in a way that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.  

**Video Testimonials**: We post video testimonials on our Service which may contain personal information such as name, photo and/or a video of the individual in the testimonial. We obtain the individual’s consent in advance to ensure we have permission to post this content publicly. To request removal of your personal information from our testimonials, please contact us at privacy@classdojo.com. 

**Analytics Services**: We use analytics services, including mobile analytics software, to help us understand and improve how the Service is being used. These services may collect, store and use information in order to to help us understand things like how often you use the Service, the events that occur within the application, usage, performance data, and from where the application was downloaded. A current list of analytics providers that we use is located here.

**Aggregated Information and Non-Identifying Information**: We may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information publicly, including with users, partners or the press in order to, for example, demonstrate how ClassDojo is used, spot industry trends, or to provide marketing materials for ClassDojo. Any aggregated information shared this way will not contain any personal information.

**Legal Requirements**: We may disclose personal information if we have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary to comply with the law, such as complying with a subpoena or other legal process. We may need to disclose personal information where, in good faith, we think it is necessary to to protect the rights, property, or safety of ClassDojo, our employees, our community, or others, or to prevent violations of our our Terms of Service or other agreements. This includes, without limitation, exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection or responding to government requests.

**Sharing with ClassDojo Companies**: Over time, ClassDojo may grow and reorganize. We may share your personal information with affiliates such as a parent company, subsidiaries, joint venture partners or other companies that we control or that are under common control with us, in which case we will require those companies to agree to use your personal information in a way that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.

**Change of control**: In the event that all or a portion of ClassDojo or its assets are acquired by or merged with a third party, personal information that we have collected from users would be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by that third party. This Privacy Policy will continue to apply to your information, and any acquirer would only be able to handle your personal information as per this policy (unless you give consent to a new policy). We will provide you with notice of an acquisition within thirty (30) days following the completion of such a transaction, by posting on our homepage, or by email to your email address that you provided to us. If you do not consent to the use of your personal information by such a successor company, you may request its deletion from the company.

In the unlikely event that ClassDojo goes out of business, or files for bankruptcy, we will protect your personal information, and will not sell it to any third party.

**With Your Consent**: Other than the cases above, we won’t disclose your personal information for any purpose unless you consent to it. Additionally, as discussed above, we will never sell or rent your personal information to advertisers or other third parties.

> Basically,
> 
> ClassDojo will never sell or rent your information to third-parties - including advertisers. We share limited amounts of personal information with third-parties who help us provide the Service (like Amazon who provides secure data storage) or when legally required.

## How Does ClassDojo Protect and Secure My Information?

Your ClassDojo account is protected by a password. You can help us protect against unauthorized access to your account by keeping your password secret at all times.

The security of your personal information is important to us. We work hard to protect ClassDojo and our community, and we maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect against unauthorized use, disclosure or access of personal information. In particular: 

* Our engineering team is dedicated to keeping your personal information secure;
* We work with a team of security researchers to continually test ClassDojo’s security practices for vulnerabilities;
* We periodically review our information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against unauthorized access to systems;
* We continually develop and implement features to keep your personal information safe - for example, when you enter any information anywhere on the Service, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL) by default;
* We ensure passwords are stored and transferred securely using encryption and salted hashing;
* We automatically delete inactive student accounts after a specific period of time, as per our retention policy, described in the “How Long Does ClassDojo Keep Children’s Information?” section;

We operate a ‘bug bounty’ security program to encourage a community of third party security researchers to report any security bugs to us. More information on this is available by contacting us at privacy@classdojo.com.

Although we make concerted good faith efforts to maintain the security of personal information, and we work hard to ensure the integrity and security of our systems, no practices are 100% immune, and we can’t guarantee the security of information. Outages, attacks, human error, system failure, unauthorized use or other factors may compromise the security of user information at any time. If we learn of a security breach, we will attempt to notify you electronically (subject to any applicable laws) so that you can take appropriate protective steps; for example, we may post a notice on our homepage (www.classdojo.com) or elsewhere on the Service, and may send email to you at the email address you have provided to us. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. 

> Basically,
> 
> The security of your personal information is important to us. We are always adding safeguards to ensure the safety and security of ClassDojo and its community of teachers, parents, and students.

## ClassDojo’s Commitments to Providing Transparency and Choice

### Can I Opt-out of Providing Information?
You may, of course, decline to share personal information with us or even block all cookies. However, it’s important to remember that many of our ClassDojo’s features may not be accessible, or may not function properly - for example, we may not be able to remember your language preferences for you.

> You can always opt-out of providing us information, though we may not be able to provide you with all of the features or functionality of ClassDojo.

### How Can I Access and Manage My Personal Information?

ClassDojo aims to provide you with easy access to any personal information we have collected about you. If that information is incorrect, we give you ways to update it, or to delete it, unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business (e.g., we need at least an email address for your account) or legal purposes. 

**Accessing Your Information**: To request access to all your personal information we have on file, please contact us at privacy@classdojo.com. In some cases, we won’t be able to guarantee complete access due to legal restrictions - for example, you will not be allowed to access files that contain information about other users or information that is confidential to us. We may not be able to fulfill requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort or would be extremely impractical.

**Updating Your Information**: You may update, correct, or delete some of your profile information or your preferences at any time by logging into your account on ClassDojo and accessing your account settings page. You may have to verify your identity before you can do that. You may also, at any time, update, correct, or delete certain personal information that you have provided to us by contacting us at privacy@classdojo.com. Please note that while your changes may be reflected promptly in active content, users that have previously accessed the content may still have access to old copies cached on their device or may have copied and stored your content. In addition, we may retain a backup copy of the prior version for a limited period of time or for legal purposes.

### How Can I Delete my Account?

We hope you’ll love using ClassDojo, and won’t delete your account! However, if for some reason you ever want to delete your account (or if you are a parent of a child, your child’s account), you can do that at any time by contacting us at privacy@classdojo.com. If you are a parent or teacher using the ClassDojo Website, you may also delete your account by logging into your account and accessing your account settings page. 

When you delete your account, we delete your profile information and any other content you provide in your profile (such as your name, username, password, email address, and profile photos) and depending on the category of user you are (i.e. teacher, parent or student), feedback points and information collected through the mobile permissions you’ve granted. Information that you have shared with others, others have shared about you, or content other users may have copied and stored, is not part of your account and may not be deleted when you delete your account. For more details, please read “What happens when I delete my account?” in our FAQs.

##How Long Does ClassDojo Keep Information About Me?

We store your personal information for as long as it is necessary to provide products and Services to you and others, including those described above. Personal Information associated with your account will be kept until your account is deleted, unless we no longer need the data to provide products and services. 

Please note that we may have to retain information after your account is closed, to comply with legal obligations, to protect the safety and security of our users or our Service, or to prevent abuse of our Terms. You can, of course, delete your account at any time, as per the “How Can I Delete my Account?” section.

**3-Tier Student Data Protection Policy**: In addition to the policy above that applies to all users, we only keep a student’s personal information for as long as the student account is active, unless we are required by law to retain it, need it to ensure the security of our users and our Service, or to enforce our Terms. More specifically, we have a 3-Tiered Student Data Protection Policy to protect students’ information: we collect minimal information from students, delete feedback points automatically after 1 year if there are no associated parent or student accounts, and delete student accounts if they are inactive for 1 year. Read more details about this student-friendly policy in the “How Long Does ClassDojo Keep Children’s Information?” section.
